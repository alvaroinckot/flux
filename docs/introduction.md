# Overview

Flux is a distributed workflow orchestration engine designed to build stateful and fault-tolerant workflows in Python. It provides a robust framework for creating, managing, and executing complex workflows with built-in support for error handling, retries, and state management.

## What is Flux?

Flux is a Python-based workflow orchestration system that allows you to:
- Define workflows as Python code using decorators
- Break down complex processes into manageable tasks
- Handle failures and retries automatically
- Maintain state across workflow executions
- Scale from local development to distributed systems

## Key Features

### High-Performance Task Execution
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute multiple tasks concurrently using built-in parallel processing
- **Task Mapping**: Apply operations across collections of data efficiently
- **Pipeline Processing**: Chain tasks together in efficient processing pipelines
- **Graph-based Workflows**: Create complex task dependencies using directed acyclic graphs

### Fault-Tolerance
- **Automatic Retries**: Configure retry attempts with customizable backoff strategies
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Define fallback behavior for failed tasks
- **Error Recovery**: Roll back failed operations with custom recovery logic
- **Task Timeouts**: Set execution time limits to prevent hanging tasks

### Durable Execution
- **State Persistence**: Maintain workflow state across executions
- **Checkpoint Support**: Create save points in long-running workflows
- **Resume Capability**: Continue workflows from their last successful state
- **Event Tracking**: Monitor and log all workflow and task events

### Workflow Controls
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause workflows at defined points and resume when ready
- **State Inspection**: Examine workflow state at any point during execution
- **Workflow Replay**: Replay workflows for debugging or recovery
- **Subworkflow Support**: Compose complex workflows from simpler ones

### Security
- **Secret Management**: Securely handle sensitive data during workflow execution
- **Encrypted Storage**: Protect sensitive data at rest
- **Access Control**: Manage who can execute and modify workflows

### API Integration
- **HTTP API**: Built-in FastAPI server for HTTP access
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Easy-to-use REST API for workflow management
- **Programmatic Access**: Python API for direct integration

### Development Features
- **Type Safety**: Full type hinting support for better development experience
- **Testing Support**: Comprehensive testing utilities for workflows
- **Debugging Tools**: Rich debugging information and state inspection
- **Local Development**: Easy local development and testing workflow
